HALLOWED MEMORY OF MY FATHER,<br />

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> those who may favor these pages with perusal, I make this earnest
request: that, if they commence, they will read all. Knowing that the
best mode of dealing with doubts is to state and refute, successively, I
regret that the plan of the present work forces a separation of the
statement and refutation. To read one without the other were to defeat
the object in view; hence my request.</p>

<p>Many of the subjects of thought are worn smooth with the touch of ages,
so that hope for originality is as slender as the bridge of Al Sirat;
but in the bulrush ark of self-confidence, pitched with Faith, I commit
my first-born to the Nile of public opinion; whether to perish by
crocodile critics, or bask in the palace of favor, the Future, alone,
must determine. May Pharaoh’s daughter find it!</p>

<h2><a name="A_NOTE" id="A_NOTE"></a>A NOTE</h2>

<p><i>First published more than thirty-five years ago, in the lifetime of the
poet, THE ANGEL IN THE CLOUD has long since passed not only out of print
but out of the memory of most living men. Of the copies of the original
edition, only few are known to exist. Upon his surviving family is
imposed the obligation, and to them comes the privilege, of rescuing
from the realm of forgotten things these evidences of a graceful and
genuine poetic gift in one whose memory they revere and whose genius
they are unwilling to have die. It is therefore with the sense of
performing a grateful duty that they have caused to be printed this new
edition of Edwin Fuller’s poems, in the hope and belief that others,
like themselves, will value it both as friends of the gentle poet and as
disinterested lovers of good literature.</i></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’<span class="smcap">Twas</span> noon in August, and the sultry heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had driven me from sunny balcony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the shaded hall, where spacious doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood open wide, and lofty windows held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sashes up, to woo the breeze, in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The filmy lace that curtained them was still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every silken tassel hung a-plumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maps and unframed pictures o’er the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave not a rustle; only now and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was heard the jingling sound of melting ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in a massive urn, whose silver sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trickling dewbeads ran. The little birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up in their cages, perched with open beaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throbbing throats, upon the swaying rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or plashed the tepid water in their cups<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eager breast. My favorite pointer lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lolling tongue, and rapid panting sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside my chair, upon the matted floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things spoke heat, oppressive heat intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save swallows twittering up the chimney-flue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hollow flutterings sounded cool alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find relief I seized my hat and book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled into the park. Along a path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of smoothest gravel, oval, curving white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between two rows of closely shaven hedge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I passed towards a latticed summer-house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairy bower, built in Eastern style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spires, and balls, and fancy trellis-work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er which was spread the jasmine’s leafy net,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To snare the straying winds. Within I fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a seat of woven cane, and fanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My streaming face in vain. The very winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to have fled, and left alone the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rise from parchèd lawn and scorching fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like trembling incense to the blazing god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves upon the wan and yellow trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung motionless, as if of rigid steel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e’en the feath’ry pendula of spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faintest oscillation, dared not wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The withered flowers shed a hot perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sickened with its fragrance; and the bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worked lazily, as if they longed to kick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow burdens from their patient thighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rest beneath the ivy parasols.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterflies refrained from aimless flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poised on blooms with gaudy, gasping wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fountain scarcely raised its languid jet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An inch above its tube; the basin deigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A feeble ripple for its tinkling fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolled the little waves with noiseless beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the marble side. The bright-scaled fish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All huddled ’neath the jutting ledge’s shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, burnished like their magnet toy types,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose and fell as if inanimate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, with a restless stroke of tinted fin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned in their places pettishly around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, with each move, the tiny whirlpools spun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like crystal dimples on the water’s face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sculptured lions crouched upon the edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gaping jaws, and stony, fixèd eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever on the pool glared thirstily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the park, beneath the trees, were grouped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deer, their noses lowered to the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To snuff a cooler air; their slender feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient stamping at the teasing flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While o’er their heads the branching antlers spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mocking skeleton of shade! A fawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his dappled coat, played here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regardless of repose; the silver bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tinkled from a band of broidered silk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaiming him a petted favorite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save him alone, all things in view sought rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearied Nature seemed to yield the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smold’ring wait her speedy sacrifice.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heat grew hotter as I watched its work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with its fervor overcome, I rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the grounds, towards an orchard bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My faltering steps in full despair of ease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down through the lengthened rows of laden trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose golden-freighted boughs o’erlapped the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hurried till I reached the last confines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stood a gnarléd veteran, now too old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear much fruit, but weaving with its leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dense a shade, the smallest fleck of sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not creep through. Beneath it spread a couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of velvet moss, fit for the slumbers of a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here prone I fell, at last amid a scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That promised refuge from the glaring heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond me stretched the orchard’s canopy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thick, rank foliage, almost drooping down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the green plush carpet underneath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close at my feet a crystal spring burst forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolled its gurgling waters down the glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now spreading in a rilling silver sheet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er some broad rock, then gath’ring at its base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a foamy pool that churned the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mingling sparks of shining isinglass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It danced away o’er gleamy, pebbly bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, midst the grassy nooks and fibrous roots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darting minnows played at hide and seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft fluttering upwards, to the top, to spit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tiny bubble out, or slyly snap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ unwary little insect hov’ring near;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, by its tributes widened to a brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It poured its limpid waters undefiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In to the river’s dun and dirty waves,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A type of childhood’s guileless purity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mingling with the sordid world is lost.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far in the distance, lofty mountains loomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their blue sides trembling in the sultry haze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me to them spread varicultured fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That formed a patchwork landscape, which deserved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pencil of a Rembrandt and his skill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hardy yellow stubble smoothly shaved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With boldness lying ’neath the scorching sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The suffering corn, with tasselled heads all bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twisted arms appealing, raised to Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meadows faded by the constant blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cattle lying in the hedge’s shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the landscape drawn a glitt’ring band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where winds the river, like a giant snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ripples flashing like his polished scales.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the scene a lonely vulture wheeled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning with every curve from side to side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the fierce rays broiled his dusky wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And circling onwards, dwindled to a speck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the distance vanished out of sight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete repose was stamped on everything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where a tireless ant tugged at a crumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drag it o’er th’ impeding spires of moss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one poor robin, with her breast all pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feather-scarce, hopped wearily along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streamlet’s edge, with plaintive clock-like chirp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And searching, found and bore the curling worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the yellow-throated brood o’erhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the mountains reared the copper clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of summer skies, that whitened as they rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till bleached to snow, they drifted dreamily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like gleaming icebergs, through the blue sublime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they, one by one, sailed far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought they were as ships from Earth to Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus slowly floating to the Eternal Port.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thunder’s muttered growl my reverie broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking toward the West, I saw a storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gloomy wrath, had thrown its dark-blue line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of breastworks, quiv’ring with each grand discharge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its own ordnance, o’er th’ horizon’s verge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some time it stood to gloat upon its prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, girding up its strength, began its march.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extending far its black gigantic arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It grimly clambered up the tranquil sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, half-way up the arch, its shaggy brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scowled down in rage upon the frightened earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While through its wind-cleft portals sped the darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brightly hurtled through the sultry air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the mountain-sides the shadow crept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dark veil spreading over field and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus adding gloom to Nature’s awful hush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleecy racks had fled far to the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sporting safely in the gilding light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mocked the angry monster’s cumbrous speed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, while I marked its progress, came a train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dark and doubting thoughts into my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bitterly thus my reflections ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange is the Providence that rules the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sets the Medean course of Nature’s laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes adapting law to circumstance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oftener making law fulfilled a curse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon brewing storm in verdant summer comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When vegetation spreads its foliage sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, like a full-rigged ship’s, are easier torn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why comes it not in winter, when the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With canvas reefed by Autumn’s furling frosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could toss in nude defiance to the blast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murd’rous wind precedes the gentle shower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the suffering grain has quenched its thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bows the heavy head, alone of worth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To give self pleasure, and to save it pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pain and pleasure are Life’s only modes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No neutral state&mdash;we suffer, or enjoy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each gained a few disciples, who avowed their truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each, by some one else, been proven wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Bentham marches out utility,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moral test from benefit or harm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the good depended on effect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good would not be good, though universe<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who’d rather give the question up, than err,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so declares it cannot be defined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Wollaston declares that good is truth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though stretched and warped, they almost deify,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And term it man’s tribunal in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he may judge his actions, right or wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What nonsense! Conscience is but consciousness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soul, and idea of its good. We form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This idea from regard of fellow-men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Association, and from thought. We find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the good of soul conflicts with flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we know the soul above the flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We yield to that the preference. Hence arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foolish notions of self disregard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savage does not know he has a soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore has no conscience. He can steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without remorse. But when he learns of soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds it has a good, and by this test<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tries moral actions, are they good for soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is conscience.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Yet is conscience changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By circumstance. The Hindoo mother tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The helpless infant from her trickling breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed the crocodile, and save her soul;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And daily we see one commit a deed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The truths of science are hypotheses,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our little numbers fit the shadow’s line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best they can, and boast eternal truth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet take a simple form of numbers, “two,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot have a perfect thought of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the mind directly asks, two what?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not enough chameleon to feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On empty air. Two units, we reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then what is meant by unity? An “One,”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind can only cognize o-n-e,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes three units and not one.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Must have a concrete object to adjust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abstract on, before it comprehends.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They never can be proved exactly ’like.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To differ, not the trillionth of a grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if they could, they may in density<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be unlike; then to equal weight, one must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be larger by the trillionth of an inch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even if alike in density and weight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A spring with gathered feet, a clash of wings,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before a large pavilion, round whose walls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I saw reflected there. The floor seemed made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tesselated froth, whose bubbles burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With constant hissing, into rainbow sparks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While like the sulph’rous canopy, that drapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At evening’s close, a gory battle-field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof of crimson vapor drooped and rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every breath and every slightest sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the center of the glowing room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a sapphire throne an Angel sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose brow Rebuke and Wisdom met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed upon me with such pitying look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet withal so stern, that all my pride<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I ran with trembling haste and near the throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kneeled down.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">“Vain man,” he said, “and hast thou dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To doubt the providence of God; Behold!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lo! one side of the pavilion rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out before me lay Immensity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frothy floor, now crumbling from the edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolved away close to my very feet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With every motion of my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Far down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, the black abyss of chaos yawned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So vast, I gasped while gazing, and so deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sun’s swift arrowy rays flash down for years,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To trace the murky glow of hidden fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beating from off the ledge the flakes of foam<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With slanting flight across the gulf he sheared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moveless wings were not extended straight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The very beauties you admire. Unjust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would enjoy effects without a cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goods of Nature often take their rise<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But Nature’s dealings towards Man are just.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows that he is free, and Nature not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he opposes Nature’s laws and falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Nature to be blamed? The widow’s cot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is frail; the laws of general good require<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A storm; it comes, and shattered falls the cot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should God have saved it by a miracle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all His people could demand the same,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Invariable of life, and still be free;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Nature, over Man, holds not a tyranny,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And yet the pleasure’s lost by very search;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What good soe’er apparently is sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consciousness of selfish aims destroys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here is wisdom manifest. When Self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seek the good, for pleasure to the Self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure is not found; but when it seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good alone, true pleasure is conferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean the Self of soul, not Self of flesh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pleasure to the sense, to be attained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sought; these two are mingled intricate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And hard to separate), in thousand ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Man’s higher Self would seek its good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must forget the Self. In every case<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You instanced, Self of soul must be unthought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pleasure will not come at call of Self.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your gambler none will doubt has selfish ends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the preacher, for his pleasure sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would ne’er be found; it must be out of thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His burning eloquence, his pastoral care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can not proceed from any love of Self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Self would suffer, when it knew their source;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as he acts from love of good as good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Self is happy. When he ascertains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That some have died in sin through his neglect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Self is grieved, not that it was uncared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For care of Self would not allay the pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that a duty had not been performed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That good had been neglected, as a good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gambler’s object may be highest good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Self, according to his estimate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preacher seeks a good, but not for Self;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Self appears, the good to evil turns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is the mystic selfish in his cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that he buries talents in himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might avail for good to other men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all his mind is bent on pleasing God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only thought of Self is for its pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this he deems acceptable to Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can not judge by your analysis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by what passes in the actor’s mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One surely then could not be selfish termed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who only lived to mortify the Self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howe’er mistaken may his conduct be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is the man, who gives his wealth away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If from right principles he gives. ’Tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds a pleasure in the deed when done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if to gain that pleasure he has given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It turns to gall and wormwood in his grasp.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If two men matches light, and know full well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If one is dropped, a house will be consumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is the most guilty that allows its fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miser, then, who knows he does a wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is by that knowledge rendered criminal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The quality of actions must be judged”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their intents, that often differ wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who shoots his friend by accident<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has no intent, and therefore does no wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he who murders does a score of wrongs,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A score of basest motives prompt the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All centred in the Self. The Christian’s work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must, from its very nature, have no Self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or it becomes unchristian. Man can judge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not from effect, but motives ascertained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By inference, and experience. The law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is formed hereon, and modified by years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time teaches men that punishment will stop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only punishment, the spread of crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instinct and Nature’s order teaches you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pain must follow wrong. A man commits<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crime; if left unpunished, he repeats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others, seeing his security,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will do as he has done. So all mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would hasten on to lawlessness and ruin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But law, for real wrong inflicts a wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which would be just did it no farther go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is proved expedient, inasmuch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it prevents continued crime. Then death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By law can not be murder termed, since good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In aim and end, without malicious thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus good to many flows from wrong to one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If that may wrong be termed that takes the rights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By conduct forfeited), who should receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though none reaped benefit. For many’s good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The law is made, yet never does a wrong<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her son’s antagonism’s not to her,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The evil shunned, because an evil. Thus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And what He loves; but to continue good<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must retain approval in the act,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not transfer it to the agent’s self.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consciousness that God approves a deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes Man approve, and thus his mind is brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In correlation with the Mind Divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who does an alms, if done to gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God’s favor for himself, feels selfish pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if because the act, not he, will please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds the pleasure. Man, as time rolls on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds general laws that please or displease God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ranging, under these, subordinates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amenable to them and not to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moral quality of lesser deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reckons by these laws, nor does ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God, that gives their moral quality.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jouffroy, in Order, placed the Abstract Good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paused a step below the real truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The idea God, whence Order emanates.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus Man, progressing, good withdraws from God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seems an independent entity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man denominates it, Abstract Good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can attain the Abstract but in part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mind is freed from flesh, he may attain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its full grandeur. Here, at most, he grasps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faint outline, and fits it on concrete.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No concept occupies one act of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But opening the lettered label, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">May count the attributes, and by an act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complex, of memory and cognition, gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some idea of his Abstract. Thus of “Man,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One act can only cognize M-A-N,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But opening, he finds the attributes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As “mammal,” “biped,” “vertebrate.” This act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is complex, and he cannot unitize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save by the bundle of a word. You’ve said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It answers all the purposes of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then why seek more? lest speculation vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Point out dim realms, where Man can never tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These baffling thoughts are given, as peacocks’ feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Man’s fond pride. The simplest avenue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thought, pursued, will reach absurdity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comprehension finite.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Even the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of numbers you presume to doubt. Two balls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if a ball the size of Earth, and one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tiny mustard-seed, would not be two!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You deem all Mathematics wide at fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because Man’s powers to illustrate are weak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth has oft seen a pure right angle drawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because Man’s sight could not detect a flaw;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In everything; his life, his neighbor’s life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The outside world, may all be but a myth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let him so believe, but let him act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consistently; but does the skeptic so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crams all Nature in his little mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet how he cringes to her slightest law!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now to close thy lesson, look through this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave to me a strangely fashioned glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which, when I had looked to Earth, I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long black wall, that towered immensely high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So none might see beyond. Before its length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind were ranged, all weaving busily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young and old, the maiden and the man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infant hands unconscious plied the thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aged with a feeble, listless move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wove the warp of Life, and drew its thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From o’er the wall; none knew how far its end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was off, nor when ’twould reach the busy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did they care, in aught by action shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bending o’er their work, without a glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the thread, that still so smoothly ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They threw the shuttle back and forth again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till suddenly the ravelled end appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell from the wall, and to the shuttle crept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the weaver laid his work aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folded hands, was wrapped within his warp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wait the Master’s sentence on his task.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the thread, in passing through their hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the various colors, from their touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tinged the different patterns that they wove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh! how different in design! Some wove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spotless fabric, whose pure simple plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was always ready for the ending thread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come when it would, no part was incomplete;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what was done, could bear th’ Inspector’s eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others wove a dark and dingy rag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bore no pattern, save its filthiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit garment for the fool who weaves for flames!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some wove the great red woof of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clashing swords, and crossing bayonets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ghastly bones, and famished widows’ homes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the grim machinery of Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain a paltry crown, or curule chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, before the crown or chair is reached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thread gives out, the work is incomplete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the gory cloak his hands have wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its stains unwashed, the hero sleeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some shuttles shape the gilded temple, Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And count on thread to weave its topmost dome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the lowest pinnacle is touched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brittle filament is snapped. Some weave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bema, with its loud applause; and some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gaudy chaplet of the bacchanal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others sweated bays of honest toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the fabrics bear the yellow stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold, o’er which the sinner and the saint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseemly strive, and he seems happiest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose work is yellowest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i12">Along the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A fountain filled with blood,” plays constantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where man may cleanse the fabric as he weaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet few avail themselves; the waters flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Man works on, without regard to stains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thread worn thin arouses him to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or breaks before the damning dyes are cleansed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And down the line I ran my anxious eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find a weaver I might recognize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw, at last, a form by mirrors known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! ’twas a shameful texture that I wove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dark its hue, so little saving white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such seldom bathing in the fountain stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not look, but bowed my blushing face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the publican of old, cried out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Be merciful to me a sinner!”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">“Rise!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angel said, “And worship God alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And finite doubts, about the Infinite,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And disappointed, bitterly complains<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what would move his deepest gratitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could he the issue of the morrow know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God sees the future, and in kindness deals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every man his complement of good.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Remember then the weakness of thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doubt because thou canst not understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To gather scattered jewels thou must kneel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on thy knees seek truth, and thou shalt find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nearer Earth thy face, the nearer Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart. And now farewell!”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">I sprang to clasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand in gratitude, but with a wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of parting benediction, he was gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in an instant, like an aerolite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With naught to bear me up, I fell to Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter and swifter, with increasing speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now bursting through a sunlit bank of cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clutching, vainly, at the yielding mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or through a cradling storm, with thunder charged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down through the open air, whose parted breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed death into my ears, while all below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed rushing up to meet and mangle me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shrieked aloud, “Oh save me!”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And awoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day was o’er, and night had drawn her shades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The twinkling eyes of Heaven shone through the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lit the tiny rain-globes on the grass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud had passed, and on th’ horizon’s verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monster firefly, with shimmering flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It slowly crawled behind the curve of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And evening’s silence deeper seemed than noon’s,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not a sound disturbed the hush of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save katydids, with quavering monotones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning contradictions from the trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All drenched and chilled, with trembling limbs I rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And homeward bent my steps; and pondering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my dream, this moral from it drew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man cannot judge the Eternal Mind by his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But must accept the mysteries of Life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As purposes Divine, with perfect ends.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Devil was sitting one morning below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he seemed much perplexed as to what he must do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his dark brows would knit, and he’d stamp on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flap his great wings till floating around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the ashes and feathers.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">At last with an air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of resolve he threw himself back in his chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit a brimstone cigar, and touched a small bell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An imp appeared, bowed, and on his face fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Cloven-foot,” said the D&mdash;&mdash;, “what’s the news from the fire?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My liege, the great ape has ceased to inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victims with terror; they fear him no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And continually crawl from the flames to the shore.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Well, Cloven-foot, I had most certainly thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from Africa’s wilds that baboon you brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d prove such a guard for the great Sulphur Lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretches would ne’er cease before him to quake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now go up to earth, and search till you find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something uglier far, then quick seize and bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring it to me; and if it beats the baboon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll reward you. Be sure to return just as soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ’tis possible, and above all things to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">An object whose countenance never will lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its hideous novelty.” The imp bowed and withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swiftly to earth on his errand he flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in vain did he search where the gorillas roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the jungles of Bengal, the fierce tiger’s home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain throughout Europe he searched every place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nowhere could he find the requisite face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frustrated and weary, with deep despair frantic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was skimming the waves of the tossing Atlantic.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few pinion strokes, and he stood on the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the New World, and through it began to explore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all was in vain, till he chanced to alight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a sweet little village, one smiling morn bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguising himself, he attended the church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not hoping to find the object of search,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But just for the fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">As he stood with the throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were watching the College girls marching along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caught a slight glimpse of Miss “Tater’s” sweet face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sprang to her side, clasped her in embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he plunged downward he said to himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Here’s one will compete with the African elf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He soon furled his wing on the Plutonian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his dark ruler his fair burden bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Valentine sender came into sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Devil himself started back with affright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Whew! whew!” whistled he, “she’ll do, I declare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go bring the baboon, and let them compare.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imp disappeared, then returned with the ape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A creature most frightful in feature and shape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head was oblong and perfectly bald,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running back from his eyes&mdash;no forehead at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyeballs were white, their sockets deep red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His long, glistening teeth strung with human-flesh shred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gore of his victims from his fingers’ ends flowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round his lank limbs candescent chains glowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In front of Miss “Taters” this creature was led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave a look, yelled, and fainted stone dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“By my tongs,” quoth the Devil, “she’s rather too hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old fellow; she’ll make a capital guard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take her down to the fire.” The imp led the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far down they went from the clear light of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down, down, till the air was all smoky and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tumult of hell seemed bursting her head;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down, down, till the piteous wails and the moans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the tortured but echoed the jeers and the groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the fiends. Down, down, till they came to the lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scorches and scalds, but never will slake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thirst of its victims. Far out on its breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would heave them anon on the red foaming crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a billow, then plunge them far deeper beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its boiling bosom, in torture to seethe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the hot shore the poor creatures would crawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pant and to rest from their terrible thrall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their bodies all smoking the lava would stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the shriveled flesh peeled from each quiv’ring limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their heart-piercing shrieks rose higher and higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the tongue of each wave licked them back in the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as soon as Miss “Taters” had come where they were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every noise was hushed, not a sound could you hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a wonder indeed, and the wonder increased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the billows of crimson their torture surge ceased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the imp had examined more closely, he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victims had fainted, the fire gone down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hurried her back to his master and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The fires are out, and the wretches are dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What, the fires extinguished! those fires of old!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take her back! I begin e’en myself to feel cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’ll ruin us all with her terrible face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’s rather hard-favored for even this place.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! darling, are you happy up in heaven?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do the angels part that golden hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tenderly as we? O Saviour dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest childhood’s tenderness. Amid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The care of countless worlds, sometimes descend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thine almighty throne of power, and find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That little yellow head, and lay it on thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth her brow with thine own pierced hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’ll kiss the wound and try to make it well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell her how we love her memory here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let her sometimes see us, that she may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember us. O Jesus, we can trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her to thy care; and when we lay us down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest, beside that lonely, little grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! let her meet us with her harp.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help us both to make that meeting sure!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Kept ever in my view Fame’s gilded dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose highest pinnacle I chose my niche,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For vain conceit had whispered in my ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I had Genius to encharm the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I looked forward to the loud applause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nations as a simple thing of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death I thought but as a fright for those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have no destiny but dying. Mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would come in age, but as a pallid seal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Honor gained, and Life’s long labors done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I had felt the breath of Asrael’s wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from my youthful head he took my father’s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from my manhood’s arms my only child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the past a little mound of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tombed with the darkest sorrow of our hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still stands, though veiling in the folds of time.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A place of sweetest rest that I would gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When weary of the burden of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus gay of thought and bright of hope, I moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the flowers of my way.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">At once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scarce a rustle in the rose leaves, came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shadowy form, and standing silently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my pathway, breathed a whispered sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it loathed its office to perform;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then laid Consumption’s ghastly banner on my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its pale folds crossed with fatal red.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">The sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew dark, the rose leaves withered, as the form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withdrew, still silently; while I, alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the roadside, kneeled to pray for light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stunned surprise of sudden shattered hopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faith of self-appointed destiny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still turned my eyes toward the Temple Fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across its gilded dome a spotless cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had drifted, hiding it from view, but lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud, unfolding snowy depths, disclosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glories of that “House not made with hands,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bending from it, so full of tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could discern the loved ones “gone before.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all I recognized the Form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose brow endured Gabbatha’s shameful crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose woe distilled itself in trickling blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Cedron’s murmuring wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">As tenderly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever mother touched her babe, He bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within His arms a little angel form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden hair and blue expressive eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One dimpled hand lay on His willing cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While He bent down to meet the sweet caress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other, with that well-remembered look<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed, and threw the kiss to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bowed my face, and longed to know mine end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twere very sweet to leave all toil and care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And join the blessed ones beyond the tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still ’twere sweet beyond compare to wait<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Then came a flute-like voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thrilled the solemn air:<br /></span>
<span class="i12">“Pursue thy way,<br /></span>

<span class="i17">Thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish to live, life’s aims subserved to God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each continued day and hour regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As special gifts to be improved for Him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear the girdle of the world about my loins<br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
